If you don't already, this requires stylus to function. Get it at the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) or the [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) website. <br> [Userscript](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus#mirrors) is also supported, though not 100% tested.<br>

## Unreleased/beta style
To find the unreleased style go to [stylustheme.css](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/blob/main/stylustheme.css).
To see the list of changes, head over to [unreleasedChanges.md](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/blob/main/unreleasedChanges.md).

## Browser Compatability
- [Brave](https://brave.com/) & most Chromium browsers
- [Firefox](https://firefox.com/) (This style is built around the [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/) and because Firefox uses a different browser engine, [Gecko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko_%28software%29), the style may not work properly, though I will fix bugs on the Firefox browser. 
### Display Compatability
Your display/monitor has to be AT LEAST **1024 pixels wide** for this style to work correctly. 
I'd recommend at least a 1366 x 768 monitor or, even better, a 1920 x 1080 monitor.
I could try and fix this, but that's too much work. You can try to fix it if you want.

All credit to Ologist for initially making this great user-style theme!
This is just me adding to it and fixing some little things.
