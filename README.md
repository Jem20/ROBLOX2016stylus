## Unreleased/beta style
To find the unreleased style go to [stylustheme.css](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/blob/main/stylustheme.css).
To see the list of changes, head over to [unreleasedChanges.md](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/blob/main/unreleasedChanges.md).

## Supported Browsers
- [Brave](https://brave.com/) and probably all [Chromium based browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)#Browsers_based_on_Chromium).
- [Firefox](https://firefox.com/) (This style is built around a Chromium browser, and because Firefox uses a different browser engine, Gecko, the style may not work properly). 
### Display Compatability
Your display/monitor needs to be at least 1024 pixels wide for this style to work correctly. \
**Note: I don't know what other people or I did, but thinner displays should work fine in any releases past 1.2.0.x.** \
I'd recommend at least a 1366 x 768 monitor or, even better, a 1920 x 1080 monitor. \
