## Contributing
**If you can, please contribute!** \
I don't know much CSS myself, so any contribution, even improving the slightest little thing, is greatly appreciated!

## Supported Browsers
- [Brave](https://brave.com/) and probably all [Chromium based browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)#Browsers_based_on_Chromium).
- [Firefox](https://firefox.com/) (Not 100% guaranteed to work, but I will fix style bugs on FireFox). 
### Display Compatability
Your display/monitor needs to be at least 1024 pixels wide for this style to work correctly. \
**Note: I don't know what other people or I did, but thinner displays should work fine in any releases past 1.2.0.x.* \
I'd recommend at least a 1366 x 768 monitor or, even better, a 1920 x 1080 monitor.
## Credit
All credit to Ologist for initially making this great user-style theme! \
