### Small changes
- [Padding] Changed the padding of game pages. 
- [Downpage] Replace Roblox down page image. I don't know how to replicate the entire thing, but the image is a start. If you want to try and fix it yourself, see this [reference](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/roblox/images/5/5a/Apr7-2015_maintenance.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20200319185127) [image](https://ibb.co/6v6LkL0).
- [Font] Removed @import for importing the font and directly added it to the style itself; UserStyles' website doesn't allow @import tags. 
- [Homepage] Removed suggested avatar items on the homepage. 
- [Homepage] Fixed favorites (on profile page) clipping outside of its parent container. 
- [Login] Facebook login button fixed. Later I'll try to make the entire login page look like 2016.
- [Play Button] Fixed play button alignment, made it more centered.
- [Item Price] Fixed item card price icon for being cut off.
- [Search page] [Removed opacity](https://pixelfed.social/storage/m/_v2/366043747065310340/7198ec0c0-99bc91/9nrmco3BrGjg/7Ko4rkJkbz2P0HMrXdylfsmR7sClFzHOpUQFAxs3.gif) and rounded off some corners. 
## Known bugs
- Under profile pages, the about section and the report section aren't connected. I'll try working on a fix for that when I have the time. 
  - Nevermind, impossible.
