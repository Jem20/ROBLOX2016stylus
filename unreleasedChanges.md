## Site breaking fixes
- [WEBSITE CHAT] Fixed website chat (background color not applying properly)
- [BETTER ROBLOX] Big thanks to [Diyamund](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/issues/7) for making BTRoblox icons to be consistent with 2016. 
- [FONT FIXES] Another fix thanks to [Diyamund](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/issues/8); implemented similar, but different font faces.
- [FONT FIXES] More font fixes from [Diyamund's pull request](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/pull/11). Fixed header and sidebar font sizes (Pull request 10/21/2021). 
- [AVATAR PAGE SIDEBAR FIX] Some stuff (paid games button) conflicted with the headers on the side. I guess Roblox decided to make both of them have the same classes, idk.
- [FRIENDS PLAYING PAID GAME] Fixed Robux icon of friends playing a paid game and changed text height so "View Details" wouldn't clip out of the container. 
## Small Changes
- [LEFT SIDE BAR] Centered (shrunk) the left sidebar. [Before](https://i.ibb.co/PwgjTcZ/image.png), [After](https://i.ibb.co/8zrZ9LH/image.png) | [Reference Image](https://imgr.search.brave.com/mYrJP_-JRZk6ViEc2S6K9afu23NDlY2rjB80ViEZwRw/fit/1200/649/ce/1/aHR0cHM6Ly92aWdu/ZXR0ZS53aWtpYS5u/b2Nvb2tpZS5uZXQv/cm9ibG94L2ltYWdl/cy9mL2ZlL0hvbWVz/Y3JlZW4ucG5nL3Jl/dmlzaW9uL2xhdGVz/dD9jYj0yMDE3MDIw/NTIyNTAwMw).
- [SEE ALL BUTTON] Changed minimum width to be more faithful to 2016.
- [SEE ALL BUTTON] Changed shadow to be more faithful to 2016. 
- [GAMES PAGE/CAROUSEL ARROW CHANGES] Fixed up arrows to be more faithful to 2016. 
- [BUTTONS] Made the "I agree" button shown when signing a Roblox contract uniform with normal buttons.  
- [AVATAR PAGE] Added line at the bottom of game catalog card and fixed View Featured Item button (background color broke when hovering)
- [PLAY BUTTON] Fixed button width. 
- [CODE CHANGES] Got rid of based thing, used to be at line [3018](https://i.ibb.co/hMXWTrX/image.png); I completely forgot that existed. (Pull request 10/21/2021).
- [HEADER] Removed header border. 
## Known bugs
- Under profile pages, the about section and the report section don't correctly splice together. I'll try working on a fix for that when I have the time.
