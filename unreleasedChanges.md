## Hello, User(script)

[**HELLO, [USER]**](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/blob/main/helloUser.user.js) - I probably should have announced this a while ago, but I made a [Userscript](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/blob/main/helloUser.user.js) that **brings back the Hello, User stuff on the home page**. Go check it out! Works with and without the Roblox 2016 style.

## Changes/Fixes 1.2.4.1

- [Header] Removed extra robux text from header and moved robux sale offer & duplicate Robux text (x2)
- [Background-color] General background-color fixes for buttons.
- [Notification box] Fixed notification box style [releasing as patch]
- [Contributors] Updated contributors!! [releasing as patch]
- [Game title] Fixed emojis being cut off
- [URL matching] Uses regex to exclude any settings page. Even though I created the script, I still didn't like having it apply to the [account settings](https://www.roblox.com/my/account) page. I'll probably make this optional before release.
