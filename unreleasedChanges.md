# Style-Preview | 1.2.1
This version is not yet 100% released and may have bugs.
Standard releases can be found at [Github/releases](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/releases).
Find the unreleased version [here](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/blob/main/stylustheme.css).
## Small changes
- [Downpage] Replace Roblox down page image. I don't know how to replicate the entire thing, but the image is a start. If you want to try and fix it yourself, see this [reference image](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/roblox/images/5/5a/Apr7-2015_maintenance.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20200319185127).
- [Font] Removed @import for importing the font and directly added it to the style itself; UserStyles' website doesn't allow @import tags. 
## Known bugs
- Under profile pages, the about section and the report section don't correctly splice together. I'll try working on a fix for that when I have the time.
