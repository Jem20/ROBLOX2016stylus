## Sitewide changes
- Removed rule that gave everything 7px padding. 
## Small changes
- [Downpage] Replace Roblox down page image. I don't know how to replicate the entire thing, but the image is a start. If you want to try and fix it yourself, see this [reference image](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/roblox/images/5/5a/Apr7-2015_maintenance.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20200319185127).
- [Font] Removed @import for importing the font and directly added it to the style itself; UserStyles' website doesn't allow @import tags. 
- [Homepage] Removed suggested avatar items on the homepage. 
- [Homepage] Fixed favorites (on profile page) clipping outside of its parent container. 
- [Login] Facebook login button fixed. Later I'll try to make the entire login page look like 2016.
- [Play Button] Fixed play button alignment, made it more centered.
- [Search] Fixed and cleaned up search results. [See images.](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/blob/main/unreleasedChanges.md#images)
- [Item Price] Fixed item card price icon for being cut off.
## Known bugs
- Under profile pages, the about section and the report section don't correctly splice together. I'll try working on a fix for that when I have the time. 
## Images
I'll put images demonstrating stuff here.
