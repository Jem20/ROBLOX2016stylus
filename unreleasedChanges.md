## Code changes
- Removed rule that gave everything 7px padding. 
## Major Changes
- [Search] Fixed and cleaned up [search](https://pixelfed.social/p/Anthony16000/366047194306153633).
- [Catalog] Fixed [card price](https://pixelfed.social/p/Anthony16000/378201306465421246) height.
### Small changes
- [Downpage] Replace Roblox down page image. I don't know how to replicate the entire thing, but the image is a start. If you want to try and fix it yourself, see this [reference](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/roblox/images/5/5a/Apr7-2015_maintenance.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20200319185127) [ima](ipfs://bafybeidt47vbu53oazqit7xs7mdmyvo7kyymweh5ldogdm25nljzraua6e/?filename=downpage2016.png)[ge](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmW96hcndqibSzRiCrs6Y1vkSqFzWVNLAxW9Fzv9stLLZW?filename=downpage2016.png).
- [Font] Removed @import for importing the font and directly added it to the style itself; UserStyles' website doesn't allow @import tags. 
- [Homepage] Removed suggested avatar items on the homepage. 
- [Homepage] Fixed favorites (on profile page) clipping outside of its parent container. 
- [Login] Facebook login button fixed. Later I'll try to make the entire login page look like 2016.
- [Play Button] Fixed play button alignment, made it more centered.
- [Item Price] Fixed item card price icon for being cut off.
## Known bugs
- Under profile pages, the about section and the report section aren't connected. I'll try working on a fix for that when I have the time.
